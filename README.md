# Civic Data Visualization Guidelines

## Overview
Civic is a data platform. Our data visualizations demonstrate the power of the Civic platform. We aim to show the viability of an open-systems, open-source approach to public data. These guidelines outline our approach to data visualization.

## Principles
### Our data visualizations should be legible
### Our data visualizations should be insightful
### Our data visualizations should be professional
### Our data visualizations should be data-rich
### Our data visualizations should advance the public conversation
### Our data visualizations should show the value of data in the hands of the community

### Embrace imperfection
> Data-driven doesn’t mean unmistakably true because data and the tools that collect it are human-made. Data is not pure fact, but evidence that filters reality in a very subjective way. It has the unique power to abstract our world and help us understand it, according to relevant factors that are different or constantly changing. *[IBM data visualization guidelines](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/experience/data-visualization)*

### Be aware of bias
A data visualization provides a lens and is a perspective on reality. Bias cannot be eliminated. There is no such thing as an unbiased data visualization. However, by being aware of bias, you can present the most accurate and useful perspectives on reality through your visualization. Societally, what is perceived as biased is based on the perspective of the observer. What data is collected, how data is collected, how data is calculated, how data is categorized, how data is contextualized, what data is presented, how data is visualized, etc... all inform bias.

### Show meaningful relationships
Data visualizations that show relationships imply meaning in those relationships. Don’t make spurious relationship between disparate data. You may have heard the phrase “correlation does not imply causation”. Well, data visualizations that show correlation without context imply causation.


### Data visualizations should be:
 * Be legible, clean, and professional
 * Communicate useful and accurate perspectives on reality
 * Aware of bias

## Chart types
### Bar chart
* horizontal
* vertical

### Line chart
### Scatterplot
### Pie/doughnut
### Maps

## Details

### Colors
### Showing quantities
* Commas
 * Always use commas for thousands separator
* Numbers and decimal places
    * Use units that will result in showing a maximum of 6 digits
        * Fewer digits is better
    * Lean towards showing 0-1 decimal places. 
        * Should reflect the precision of the data
        * Show whole dollars or dollars and cents (e.g. $123 or $1.23)
    * Examples
        * $7.3 million, not $7,300,000
        * 24%, not 23.79%
        * $535,000
* Show units (e.g. dollar sign, percent)

### Responsiveness
### Labelling and annotation
### Legends
### Proper scaling
### Tooltips
### Accessibility
* Low vision
* Color blind

### Titles
### Responsiveness
### Interaction
### Small multiples
